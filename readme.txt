Hi there and welcome to my project!

This is a quick website I made using HTML and CSS for my friend Bens birthday. I did this by following the
scrimba course that is linked at the bottom of the page. I pulled it off the platform into VSCode to practice using git
rather than just deploying it straight away. I tested the code by using the liveserver extention here on VSCode
and added a HTML 5 boiler plate as well to ensure compatablity. 

Used a combination of my own images and pulled gifs from tenor and giphy for use in the page. 

For future projects I will be adding alt text and additional accessablity features!

Happy Coding,
Joe
